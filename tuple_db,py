# Simulating an SQL table using only tuples (no lists, no dicts)

# Step 1: Create a table (tuple of tuples)
students = (
    (1, "Chinmay", 22),
    (2, "Raj", 25),
    (3, "Aditi", 20),
)

# Step 2: Select rows (like SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 21)
def select_students_by_age(table, min_age):
    return tuple(row for row in table if row[2] > min_age)

# Step 3: Insert a row (like INSERT INTO students VALUES (...))
def insert_row(table, new_row):
    return table + (new_row,)  # tuples are immutable, so return a new one

# Example usage
students = insert_row(students, (4, "Neha", 23))
results = select_students_by_age(students, 21)

print("All students:", students)
print("Students older than 21:", results)

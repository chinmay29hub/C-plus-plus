### 1. What is Node.js?

**Answer:**  
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine and is designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient, ideal for data-intensive real-time applications like chat apps, streaming services, or IoT systems.

**Example:**  
You can create a simple HTTP server with Node.js using minimal code:

```js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', () => {
  console.log('Server running at http://127.0.0.1:3000/');
});
```

**Why It Matters:**  
Understanding Node.jsâ€™s core definition and use cases shows your grasp of its role in modern web development, especially for real-time applications.

### 2. Why use Node.js?

**Answer:**  
Node.js is favored for its fast processing speed, non-blocking I/O operations, and ability to handle many concurrent connections with low resource usage. It allows developers to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend, creating a unified development experience. Node.js is particularly useful for real-time applications like chat applications, streaming services, and collaborative tools due to its event-driven architecture.

**Example:**  
In a traditional server, a database query might block the server from handling other requests. In Node.js, non-blocking I/O means the server can process other requests while waiting for the database, improving performance.

**Why It Matters:**  
This question tests your understanding of Node.jsâ€™s advantages, especially its suitability for scalable, real-time applications.

---

### 3. How does Node.js work?

**Answer:**  
Node.js operates on an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. When a client sends a request, itâ€™s added to an event queue. The event loop processes these events one by one. Simple requests are handled directly by the event loop, while complex I/O tasks (like file or database operations) are offloaded to a thread pool, allowing the event loop to continue processing other requests.

**Example:**  
Imagine a Node.js server handling multiple clients:

- Client A requests data from a database.  
- While waiting, the server handles Client Bâ€™s request for a static file.  
- When Client Aâ€™s database response is ready, itâ€™s queued and processed later by the event loop.

**Why It Matters:**  
This question evaluates your knowledge of Node.jsâ€™s architecture, particularly its event loop and non-blocking nature.

### 4. Why is Node.js Single-threaded?

**Answer:**  
Node.js is single-threaded to simplify asynchronous processing and achieve better performance under typical web loads. Using a single thread avoids the complexity of managing multiple threads, reducing issues like race conditions or deadlocks common in multi-threaded systems.

**Example:**  
In multi-threaded systems, multiple threads accessing shared data can cause errors. Node.jsâ€™s single-threaded model with asynchronous I/O avoids these issues, handling tasks like file reads without blocking.

**Why It Matters:**  
This question checks your understanding of Node.jsâ€™s design philosophy and how it achieves efficiency.

---

### 5. If Node.js is single-threaded, then how does it handle concurrency?

**Answer:**  
Node.js handles concurrency using its event-driven architecture and non-blocking I/O. When an I/O operation (like reading a file) is initiated, itâ€™s handled by the operating systemâ€™s thread pool, freeing the main thread to process other events. The event loop manages callbacks, ensuring multiple tasks are handled efficiently.

**Example:**  
When reading a file, Node.js doesnâ€™t wait for the operation to complete. Instead, it continues processing other requests, and the fileâ€™s callback is handled once the read is done:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('example.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

**Why It Matters:**  
This question tests your grasp of how Node.js achieves scalability despite being single-threaded.

---

### 6. What is NPM?

**Answer:**  
NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to install, share, and manage dependencies (libraries or tools) for Node.js projects. NPM uses a package.json file to track project dependencies, versions, and scripts, simplifying the inclusion of third-party modules.

**Example:**  
To install Express.js, a popular web framework, run:

```bash
npm install express
```

This adds Express.js to your project and updates package.json.

**Why It Matters:**  
NPM is central to Node.js development, and this question assesses your familiarity with dependency management.

---

### 7. What are modules in Node.js?

**Answer:**  
Modules in Node.js are reusable blocks of code that provide specific functionality. They can be built-in (e.g., http, fs, path) or user-defined. Modules help organize code into separate files, improving maintainability and reusability in large applications.

**Example:**  
Create a module in `math.js`:

```js
// math.js
exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;
exports.subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
```

Use it in `app.js`:

```js
// app.js
const math = require('./math');
console.log(math.add(5, 3)); // Outputs: 8
```

**Why It Matters:**  
This question evaluates your ability to structure Node.js code effectively using modules.

---

### 8. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions in Node.js?

**Answer:**

- **Synchronous functions:** Block execution until the task completes, suitable for quick operations without external resources.  
- **Asynchronous functions:** Donâ€™t block execution, allowing other tasks to run while waiting for I/O operations, using callbacks, promises, or async/await.

**Example:**  
Synchronous file read (blocks execution):

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt');
console.log(data);
```

Asynchronous file read (non-blocking):

```js
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('example.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

**Why It Matters:**  
This question tests your understanding of Node.jsâ€™s non-blocking nature, a core feature for performance.

---

### 9. What are the advantages of using promises instead of callbacks?

**Answer:**  
Promises offer a structured way to handle asynchronous operations, improving readability and avoiding "callback hell" (nested callbacks). They provide built-in error handling with `.catch()` and allow chaining of operations, making code cleaner and easier to maintain.

**Example:**  
Using callbacks:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});
```

Using promises:

```js
const fs = require('fs').promises;
fs.readFile('file.txt')
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```

**Why It Matters:**  
This question assesses your knowledge of modern asynchronous programming techniques in Node.js.

---

### 10. What is middleware in Node.js?

**Answer:**  
Middleware in Node.js, especially in frameworks like Express.js, are functions that process requests in the request-response cycle. They can modify request/response objects, perform tasks like logging or authentication, or pass control to the next middleware using the `next()` function.

**Example:**  
A simple Express.js middleware to log request URLs:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Request URL:', req.originalUrl);
  next();
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

**Why It Matters:**  
Middleware is a key concept in Express.js, and this question tests your understanding of request processing in Node.js frameworks.

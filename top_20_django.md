### 1. What is Django?

Django is a high-level Python web framework that helps developers build web applications quickly and securely. It is free and open-source, with a large community of developers contributing to it. Django is often called a "batteries-included" framework because it comes with many built-in features like an admin interface, authentication system, and database management.

**Key Features:**
- **Rapid development:** Django handles much of the heavy lifting, so you can focus on writing your application.
- **Security:** Built-in protections against common web attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Scalability:** Suitable for small projects and large, high-traffic websites.
- **Versatility:** Used for building everything from simple blogs to complex e-commerce platforms.

**Example:**
To start a new Django project, you can use the following command:
```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
```
This creates a new directory called `myproject` with the basic structure for a Django application.

### 2. What are the features of Django?

Django comes with several features that make it a powerful tool for web development:

- **High-level framework:** It abstracts away many low-level details, allowing you to focus on your application logic.
- **Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture:** Separates the application into three components for better organization.
- **Object-Relational Mapper (ORM):** Lets you interact with databases using Python code instead of raw SQL.
- **Admin interface:** A built-in interface for managing your application's data.
- **Security:** Includes protections against common vulnerabilities like CSRF and XSS.
- **Scalability:** Can handle large-scale applications with high traffic.
- **Community support:** A large, active community provides documentation, tutorials, and plugins.

**Example:**
Django's ORM allows you to define a database table as a Python class:
```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    published_date = models.DateField()
```
This defines a Book model with fields for title, author, and publication date.

---

### 3. Explain Django’s architecture.

Django follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which is a variation of the traditional Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. In MVT:

- **Model:** Represents the data structure and database schema. It defines how data is stored and retrieved.
- **View:** Handles the logic for processing requests and returning responses. It fetches data from the model and passes it to the template.
- **Template:** Defines the structure of the HTML (or other formats) that the user sees. It renders the data provided by the view.

**Example:**
Consider a blog application:

- **Model:** A Post model defines the structure of blog posts (e.g., title, content, date).
- **View:** A function retrieves all posts from the model and passes them to the template.
- **Template:** An HTML file displays the list of posts.

```python
# models.py
from django.db import models

class Post(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    content = models.TextField()
    published_date = models.DateTimeField()

# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Post

def post_list(request):
    posts = Post.objects.all()
    return render(request, 'blog/post_list.html', {'posts': posts})
```

```html
<!-- templates/blog/post_list.html -->
{% for post in posts %}
    <h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>
    <p>{{ post.content }}</p>
{% endfor %}
```

### 4. What is the difference between Flask and Django?

Both Flask and Django are Python web frameworks, but they cater to different needs:

- **Django:** A full-featured framework with many built-in components (e.g., ORM, admin interface, authentication). It’s ideal for larger, complex applications where you want to start quickly.
- **Flask:** A lightweight, micro framework that gives you more control over your application structure. It’s better for smaller projects or when you want to build only what you need.

**Example:**
- Use Django for a full-fledged e-commerce site with user accounts and an admin panel.
- Use Flask for a simple API or a small personal blog.

---

### 5. How do you check for the version of Django installed on your system?

You can check the version of Django installed on your system by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m django --version
```

This will display the version number of Django.

---

### 6. What are the advantages of using Django?

Some key advantages of Django include:

- **Rapid development:** Built-in features reduce the need to write everything from scratch.
- **Security:** Built-in protections against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability:** Handles high-traffic applications effectively.
- **Versatility:** Suitable for a wide range of applications.
- **Active community:** Extensive documentation and community support.

---

### 7. Give a brief about the Django admin.

Django comes with a built-in admin interface that allows you to manage your application’s data through a user-friendly interface. It’s automatically generated based on your models and can be customized.

**Example:**
To enable the admin interface for a model, register it in `admin.py`:

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import Post

admin.site.register(Post)
```

You can then access the admin interface at `/admin/` after creating a superuser.

---

### 8. How do you connect your Django Project to the database?

Django supports multiple databases, including SQLite (default), PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle. You configure the database in the `settings.py` file.

**Example:**
For SQLite:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

For PostgreSQL:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

### 9. What are the various files that are created when you create a Django Project?

When you run `django-admin startproject myproject`, Django creates:

- `manage.py`: A command-line utility for administrative tasks.
- `myproject/`: The project package.
  - `__init__.py`: Makes the directory a Python package.
  - `settings.py`: Configuration file for the project.
  - `urls.py`: Defines URL patterns for the project.
  - `wsgi.py`: Entry point for WSGI-compatible web servers.

---

### 10. What is Django ORM?

Django’s Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) allows you to interact with databases using Python code instead of raw SQL. It abstracts the database layer, making it easier to work with data.

**Example:**
```python
# Create a new post
post = Post(title='My First Post', content='Hello, world!', published_date=datetime.now())
post.save()

# Retrieve all posts
posts = Post.objects.all()

# Filter posts by title
posts = Post.objects.filter(title__contains='First')
```

---

### 11. What are models in Django?

Models are Python classes that define the structure of your data and how it should be stored in the database. Each model corresponds to a database table.

**Example:**
```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=200)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    published_date = models.DateField()
```

---

### 12. What are views in Django?

Views are Python functions (or classes) that handle requests and return responses. They process user input and generate output.

**Example:**
```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

def hello(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world!")
```

---

### 13. What are templates in Django?

Templates are files that define the structure of HTML (or other formats) your application will render. They use placeholders for dynamic data.

**Example:**
```html
<h1>{{ book.title }}</h1>
<p>By {{ book.author }}</p>
```

---

### 14. What are URLs in Django?

URLs in Django are defined in `urls.py` and map URL patterns to views. They act as the entry point for your application.

**Example:**
```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.hello, name='hello'),
]
```

---

### 15. What is the difference between a project and an app in Django?

- **Project:** The entire application, containing multiple apps and settings.
- **App:** A self-contained module for specific functionality (e.g., a blog app, a user app).

**Example:**
A blog project might have a blog app for posts and a users app for authentication.

---

### 16. How to configure static files in Django?

Static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images) need to be served by the web server. In development, Django can serve them automatically.

**Steps:**
- Add `'django.contrib.staticfiles'` to `INSTALLED_APPS`.
- Define `STATIC_URL` in `settings.py`:
```python
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
```

- Use the `{% static %}` tag in templates:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}">
```

---

### 17. What is user authentication in Django?

Django provides a built-in authentication system for handling user accounts, groups, permissions, and sessions.

**Example:**
Use `LoginView` and `LogoutView` from `django.contrib.auth.views`:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.views import LoginView, LogoutView

urlpatterns = [
    path('login/', LoginView.as_view(), name='login'),
    path('logout/', LogoutView.as_view(), name='logout'),
]
```

---

### 18. What are Django Middleware?

Middleware are hooks into Django’s request/response processing. They can modify requests or responses globally.

**Example:**
Common middleware includes `SecurityMiddleware` and `AuthenticationMiddleware`, listed in `settings.py`.

---

### 19. What are Django Signals?

Signals allow you to trigger actions when certain events occur (e.g., saving a model).

**Example:**
Send an email when a new user is created:
```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.core.mail import send_mail
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def send_welcome_email(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        send_mail('Welcome', 'Thank you!', 'from@example.com', [instance.email])
```

---

### 20. What is caching in Django?

Caching stores frequently accessed data to improve performance. Django supports various caching backends like in-memory and database caching.

**Example:**
Cache a view for 15 minutes:
```python
from django.views.decorators.cache import cache_page

@cache_page(60 * 15)
def my_view(request):
    # Expensive computation
    return render(request, 'my_template.html')
```
